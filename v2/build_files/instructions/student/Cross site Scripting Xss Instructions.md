# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Workout Instructions Made Easy

Welcome to your team's Cross-Site Scripting workout! This is where you'll learn how to perform different types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on a website.

## How to Start

To begin, go to your student landing page and click the "Enter Workout" button. This will take you to UA Little Rock: Classified's cross-site scripting workout.

## What You'll Do

During this workout, you'll explore three types of XSS attacks: DOM-based, reflected, and stored cross-site scripting. You can choose which type you want to work on first.

## DOM-Based XSS

DOM stands for the document object model, which is like a structure that a webpage has. It helps JavaScript create dynamic elements on the page, such as changing how it looks or behaves. In a DOM-Based XSS attack, the malicious actions occur within this structure and don't leave your web browser.

Imagine the webpage's URL as part of this structure. You can use it to manipulate a specific section of the webpage. In this part of the workout, there's a way to use a request to trick the webpage into doing something malicious without leaving your browser. For example, you could change the title of the page to "Classified DOMED" and display a message saying "Successful DOM-Based Attack."

## Reflected XSS

In a reflected XSS attack, the website immediately sends back what you type into a text box, without checking if it's safe or not. This means you can make the website display and execute your own code. In this workout section, there's a text box where you can input your own code, such as JavaScript.

## The Goal

The goal of this workout is to help you understand how these types of attacks work and how websites can be vulnerable to them. By practicing these exercises, you'll learn more about web security and how to prevent these kinds of attacks from happening.
