2. **Daily Shutdown:** All servers undergo a daily shutdown at midnight US Central Standard Time. If your work extends past midnight, you'll need to restart the server after this period.

3. **Data Persistence:** Although the server is equipped to handle new tool installations and project tasks, its lifespan is limited to the semester. 
   - **Always backup** your code locally or push it to your personal GitHub repository.
   - The server will be decommissioned post-semester. Any data not backed up will be lost permanently.
