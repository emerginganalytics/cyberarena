# Reversus: Instructions for Students on Hacking the Shapes

## The Main Idea: Keeping Computer Systems Safe

Computers use both software (programs) and hardware (physical components) to perform tasks. This exercise focuses on understanding software complexity by analyzing memory instructions. We'll use tools for reverse engineering, which means figuring out how software interacts with the system.

## Explaining Software Vulnerabilities

In this activity, we'll explore weaknesses related to software security. Sometimes, harmful software hides by merging with commonly used programs on a computer. In this exercise, you'll modify software to fix a seemingly unwinnable game. However, be aware that similar modifications could also be used for harmful purposes.

## Getting Started

Welcome to Hack the Shapes! Here, we'll learn about reverse engineering in video games. Imagine playing a game where you can use modifications created by others. Games like Minecraft have communities that modify the game without understanding the source code. However, some games require deep analysis to create such modifications.

Reverse engineering games can help us learn about systems, but there can be problems, especially in multiplayer games. Have you encountered players cheating with abilities like flying or invincibility? These ruin the fun. To tackle this, game companies use anti-cheat systems, although they're not flawless.

Remember, software licenses might limit reverse engineering. If unsure, make sure you have permission. If you discover weaknesses, let the software provider know.

## Other Uses

These skills can also be applied to test application security and understand programs without having access to the source code. When testing applications, you could even create a demonstration of vulnerabilities to show how a program could be attacked.

## Tools You'll Use

- Cheat Engine
- Hex Editor (Optional)

## Basic Controls in the Game

- Arrow Keys: Move
- Z: Drop $5
- Enter: Interact
- Shift: Run
- Ctrl: Slow walk
- R: Restart game

## Setting Up Cheat Engine

1. Open both Cheat Engine and the game.
2. In Cheat Engine, click the magnifying glass icon on the top left to access the process list.
3. Find "HackTheShapes.exe" in the list and open it.

## The Goal of the Game

In this game, "Hack the Shapes," your goal is to obtain red, green, and blue keys to clear the way to the flag. To get these keys, you need to tackle various levels and challenges. Some challenges require hacking and reverse engineering.

## Navigating the Game

At the main area, you'll find three colored locks and warp points to levels. You can tackle levels in any order and might find different solutions.

## Challenges and Keys

1. **Blue Key:** Buy it for $10000 using a special button.

3. **Green Key:** You have locks but not enough keys. Think about getting more keys.

5. **Red Key:** Move a block onto a pink square to unlock it. A solid wall blocks you, but there might be a way to move it.

Once you gather all the special keys, you can reach the flag.

## Additional Notes

- Use "Slow walk" (Ctrl) when passing through narrow spaces.
- Be cautious when altering addresses in the "Red Key" room; you might get stuck.
- Choose "Double" as the scan type in Cheat Engine for this game's values.
- Need help? Check Cheat Engine's provided tutorial.

Have fun exploring and learning in Hack the Shapes!
