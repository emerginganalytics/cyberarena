# Password Policy Student Workout Instructions

In this exercise, you'll discover how to adjust the rules for creating passwords on a Windows computer. These rules, known as a **"password policy,"** are like guidelines set by computer administrators. They make sure that people on a shared network create strong and secure passwords.

## Getting into Your Computer:

1. Go to the Guacamole web server. Use the provided login details. If a page doesn't show up, try refreshing the page. You'll be logged in automatically.

## Your Task:

Imagine you're working for a company. They want you to tweak the rules for making passwords. Here's what they're asking for:

1. **Turn on password complexity:** This means passwords should have a mix of different types of characters to make them strong.
2. **Make passwords at least 12 characters long.**
3. **Set a maximum password age of 365 days:** After a year, people will need to change their passwords.

If you finish the exercise but the completion doesn't show, follow these steps:

1. Open the start menu.
2. Find and open **"Command Prompt."**
3. In the window that appears, type: `gpupdate /force`
4. Press Enter. This will make sure the new rules are applied.

Remember, the goal is to make passwords stronger and more secure.
