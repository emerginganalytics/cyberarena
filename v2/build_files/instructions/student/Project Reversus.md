# Project Reversus

Welcome to Project Reversus, an educational journey where you'll discover how to understand the inner workings of small programs even without access to their original source code. It's like taking apart a clock to see how it ticks without having the blueprints.

## Investigating Like a Detective

Think of this as investigating a mystery. Just as detectives use different methods to solve cases, we have two main ways to figure out how these programs work:

1. **Static Analysis:** This is like examining a painting without touching it. We analyze the program without running it.
2. **Dynamic Analysis:** This is like watching a movie scene by scene. We analyze the program as it runs, observing its behavior.

For most challenges, we can solve the mystery by examining the painting (static analysis). Only a few cases require watching the movie (dynamic analysis). When we do that, we might also keep an eye on any messages it sends out to the world.

## Your Mission: Solving Digital Puzzles

Imagine you're on a mission. You'll log into a special computer with programs you need to figure out – puzzles named "crackthis."

To start, use the provided username and password to log in through Guacamole.

Your objective is to uncover the hidden secrets within these programs. After logging in, you'll see a folder called "Reverse Engineering." Think of this as opening a treasure chest. Inside, there's another folder called "Crackthis" – where the real adventure begins.

## Unveiling Hidden Codes

Inside the "Crackthis" folder, you'll find six different files – each like a locked box with a secret code. Your task is to discover these codes using special tools. Some boxes can be opened with a simple double-click. Others need a special key – like a secret password in a magical language called the "command line." Don't worry; a shortcut to this key is provided in the folder.

You'll use tools with intriguing names like IDA or Ollydbg. These act like magnifying glasses, helping you see the tiny details of the locked boxes. As you look closely, you'll uncover the hidden codes that prove you've cracked the puzzle.

## Embrace Your Inner Digital Detective

Think of yourself as a digital detective, solving mysteries in the world of computers. Remember, just like detectives have various tools and techniques, you'll have your reversing tools and techniques to unveil the secrets of each program.
