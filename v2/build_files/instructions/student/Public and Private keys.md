# Unlocking Secrets: Sending Hidden Messages Safely

## Introduction
Welcome to the secret messages workout! Here, we'll delve into public and private key encryption. Imagine sending messages online – they could be intercepted by sneaky attackers. But wait! Encryption techniques were designed to make it really tough for them to read your messages.

## What is Public Key Encryption?
Think of it as a lock and key, but a bit different. Public key encryption uses a pair of keys – a public one and a private one. Imagine you give everyone the public key, but only you keep the private key. People can use the public key to lock messages, but only you with the private key can unlock and read them. This is super secure, though a tad slower. Examples include RSA and DSA.

## What is Private Key Encryption?
This is like having just one key that locks and unlocks. It's fast and safe, but here's the catch: everyone sharing info needs the same key. That's like sharing a password with friends – if it gets into the wrong hands, trouble could follow. Algorithms like AES, DES, and RC4 use this. AES is the VIP here – it's ultra-secure and even approved by top-secret agencies.

## Getting into Your Computer
Use the username and password you got to log in through Guacamole.

## Your Mission
1. Once you're in, find a program called Kleopatra.
2. Use Kleopatra to create a new key pair.
3. Write a message in a text editor (like notepad).
4. Use Kleopatra to lock the message using the public key (not the whole file!).
5. Challenge time: Unlock the message with your private key.

Remember, we're turning messages into secret codes only you can understand!
