 # Johnny Cipher: Introduction to Secret Codes

In this activity, you'll use simple techniques to solve a puzzle involving secret codes. Imagine solving a mystery by decoding messages, just like a detective!

When you start the activity, you'll see three messages that are scrambled using a basic code called the Caesar Cipher. Think of it like a secret language. Your goal is to figure out the original message hidden in each scrambled text.

## Follow these steps:

1. Copy the scrambled text into the "Encrypted Message" box.
2. Use the tools we provide to figure out the secret code (key) used to scramble the message.
3. You have two ways to solve it:
   a. The "brute force" way where you try different keys until one works. This might take longer.
   b. The smarter way where you analyze the scrambled message to find clues. This is faster and more efficient.

Once you decode the message, copy and paste the real message into the corresponding box. We'll check if you got it right, and you'll earn points for each correct answer.

Your goal is to solve all three scrambled messages. It's like completing a workout for your brain!
