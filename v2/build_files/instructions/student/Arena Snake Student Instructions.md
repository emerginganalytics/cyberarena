# Arena Snake Student Workout Instructions 

Welcome to the **Arena Snake** workout! In this activity, you'll learn about security concerns related to tools that developers use. You'll use a special tool in your web browser to work with information from a website's backend. Your goal is to win a challenging game.

Imagine you're in a place called **Trojan Cyber Arena**. Here, we think it's important to take breaks and have fun. Our interns create games to relax, but one intern got carried away and made a game that hides a secret flag. We need your help to find a way to win the game and get the flag back.

To start, go to your student page and click the "Enter Workout" button for the **UA Little Rock: Classified's Arena Snake** workout.

Your task is to beat the Snake game and understand how the scoring works. Then, you'll use a tool to look behind the scenes of the game (like peeking backstage in a theater) and make some changes so you can ignore the scoring rules.

Here's the step-by-step:

1. Play the Snake game and see how the scoring works.
2. Open a special tool in your browser (it's like a secret detective tool) to look at the game's hidden parts.
3. Change some settings using this tool to ignore the scoring rules.

That's it! Have fun and good luck beating **Arena Snake** and getting the flag!
