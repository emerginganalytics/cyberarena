# Ransomware

Welcome to the **Ransomware Experience Guide**, where you'll get hands-on exposure to a common cyberattack called ransomware. Ransomware is a type of attack that covertly encrypts a victim's files. It then rapidly spreads to encrypt more files within a network or organization. Once the encryption is done, the victim is notified and asked to pay a ransom in order to regain access to their files.

No need to worry – this experience is completely free, and you won't be required to make any Bitcoin payments!

This guide will walk you through the steps of initiating a simulated cyberattack and then recovering your files using the open-source ransomware tool called NekRos. NekRos safely mimics the ransomware process without causing any harm to your files or infecting other computers.

## Your Objectives

### Attack Objective:

1. Log in and take note of the items on the desktop.
2. When you're ready to begin, double click on the 'Free Vacation' application located on the desktop. If the attack doesn't start immediately, wait a few minutes and try clicking on the application again.
3. Follow the ransomware instructions to decrypt the files on the computer. It's important not to close the application prematurely, as doing so will prevent file recovery.
4. The attack mission will automatically indicate completion once you've successfully executed the attack.

### Defense Objective:

1. After completing the attack mission, your next step is to focus on defense.
2. Utilize Windows Defender to accomplish the defense mission.
3. Learn about Ransomware Protection for Windows Defender by visiting [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/controlled-folders).
4. Configure your server with Ransomware protection.
5. Re-run the attack. If you've successfully configured the protection, your desktop files should remain unaffected.
6. The defense mission will be marked as complete once you've successfully configured your server for protection.
